  <h1>About Me</h1>

 <p> "Hi! Welcome to Kidney Konnect. Thanks for stopping by! I was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease at 21 years of age while pregnant. I was diagnosed as Stage 3. With diet and exercise I was able to stay there for about 15 years. Fall of 2018 I was informed that I would need to start dialysis soon. I chose to do peritoneal dialysis because I fel it would fit the lifestyle I wanted to have, even if that included dialysis. Peritoneal allowed me to do dialysis at night while I was asleep. I had most of my daytime free. I hope that my knowledge from going from dialysis to kidney translplant December 2020 will give you the insight you're seeking. If not shoot me a message, I'll be happy to answer any questions.</p>
